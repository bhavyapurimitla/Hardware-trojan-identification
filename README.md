# Hardware-trojan-identification
With rising complexity in global hardware manufacturing, the risk of hardware Trojans has increased. Traditional methods like SVM, KNN, and Logistic Regression lack accuracy, so this project uses CNN, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Decision Tree models for stronger feature extraction and reliable HT detection.
