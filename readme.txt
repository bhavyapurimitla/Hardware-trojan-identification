Title: hardware Trojan identification and stoppage 

Descroption:
The main aim of this project is using machine learning algorithms to predict hardware Trojan or benign.
In existing system svm, knn, logistic regression and it provided inaccurate and inaccurate output.
In proposed system we can enhanced inaccuracy by using CNN, Random Forest , XGBoost and Decision tree.
By implementing advanced machine learning algorithms to enhance efficiency and accuracy to predict hardware trojan or benign.

proposed: rf, dt, cnn, knn, logistic regression and xtream gradient boosting 

existing: knn, svn, lr
